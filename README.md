This is the code for the online compelling preaching experiment.
There are three folders to download: one is for laymen ("laymen"),
one is the AV for experts ("expert_av") and one is just the audio
for experts ("expert_audio"). There are two additional files that
need to be downloaded as well: "expert_or_laymen.html" is for choosing
between the expert study and the laymen study and "av_or_audio.html" 
is for choosing between the audio and AV versions of the expert study
so that your quality control testing lives will be easier (it will not
be included in the final experiment).

Once you have downloaded these I reccomend that you put them all in one
big folder called "homilies". So when you open up the "homilies" folder
you will see three folders and the two files I mentioned above.

Then you need to go to the compelling preaching folder on Box, go to the Edited Homilies folder and download the Humility_is_Measured... mp4 and
mp3 file from the "Weak AV Final" and "Weak A Final" folders respectively.
Then move the mp3 file into the "expert_audio" folder along with its other
html files and move one copy of the mp4 file into each of "expert_av" and
"laymen". I have just been testing with one shorter video at the moment
and this will get changed later, but for now that is how it works.

If you want to run the experiment from the beginning you can either run
"expert_or_laymen.html" from VSCode or you can navigate to it in your file
explorer and double-click it from there. Similarly, if you wish to run just one specific file then you can navigate to it in the file explorer
and double-click it or run it from VSCode. 

Please let me know if you find any bugs, missing questions, misworded questions and what you all come up with for the introduction and instruction screens so that I can change it accordingly. Any and
all suggestions/help is appreciated.

Missing features as of now (1/5/24):
No functionality for checking word count, 
User can still reverse through the experiment, 
No way to iterate through homilies multiple times, 
User data is not stored, 
No backend/server support at all
